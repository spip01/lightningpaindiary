            I'm disabled with migraines that I've fought with for the last 20 years. All the pain diaries I've ever tried never did what
            I needed or what my doctor wanted. So, I decided to write my own. Since I know there are others with the same
            concerns I decided to publish it on the web. Let me know what you think, any suggestions or concerns. Just send
            an email to me at lightningpaindiary.com --Stephen
        </p>

        <p>
            To use the page start with
            <a href="settings.html">Settings</a> under the login menu. Nothing on the page can be saved unless you're logged in.
        </p>

        <h4>
            <a href="settings.html">Settings</a>
        </h4>

        <p>
            Start by entering your city and state info so you can fetch the daily weather to save it with your diary entries. Hitting
            "enter" after setting the city info will display the latitude and longitude of the specified city.
        </p>

        <p>
            The "Trackers" tab lets you edit all the fields you want to save with your diary. It's populated with fields for migraines
            and some other example fields to start with but this can be completely changed. The other tabs let you edit list
            of items you want as checkboxes on the input page. If you delete items the associated data isn't deleted it'll
            just be hidden. You can have it displayed again by re-adding the item back to the list. The "delete" buttons
            can be enabled using the checkbox beside the title. To add and entry just give it a name, select the field type,
            type in a range if needed and hit "add". The field type can't be edited after it's created. The date, time and
            pain level fields can't be edited or deleted.
        </p>

        <h4>
            <a href="index.html">Input</a>
        </h4>

        <p>
            This page is for your diary input. You'll see all the fields you've setup on the "Trackers" tab. All the fields are optional
            except the date, time and pain level. The current date and time can be set by hitting the "Now" button adjacent
            to the time field. The "add item" field within each checkbox list is not added to the list as a new checkbox
            but is a one time add. If you want it to always be available you'll have to add it on the "Trackers" tab. The
            weather is fetched by hitting the adjacent "Now" button. The "Save" button will overwrite an existing entry with
            the same date and time or create a new one.
        </p>

        <h4>
            <a href="reports.html">Reports</a>
        </h4>

        <p>
            This page is completely configurable using the "Open Selectors" and "Open Filters" boxes. Selectors will only display the
            selected items for each diary entry. You'll see checkboxes for every field and every item in a list. The "all
            others" checkbox will show any additional items associated with that list. Filters control which diary entries
            are displayed. The checkboxes will hide any entry that doesn't contain at least one of the items checked or is
            outside of the specified date range. So, any entry that has one match and has an included date will be displayed.
            The same controls work for the table and calendar displays. You can create or modify any report by specifying
            a name and hitting "Save". A report is the selectors and filters combined. Likewise, you can delete a report.
            After saving a report it'll be added to the menu for easy selection later. The last report saved or selected
            will be the one loaded at startup. The "All On" report can't be modified. "Cancel" will reload the current report.
        </p>

        <p>
            The "Table" and "Calendar" tabs will show the corresponding report. You'll see everything you've selected displayed. There
            is a radio button by each entry which will allow editing or deleting that entry. Just use the appropriate buttons
            located under the tabs.
        </p>
